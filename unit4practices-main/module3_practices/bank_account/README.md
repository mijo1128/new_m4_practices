For this you are to create a class object called BankAccount().

The BankAcccount() object should have three fields, name, balance, and account number.

The balance should start at 0.

The account number should start at 1 and increase by 1 for each additional back account created.

You should also be able to deposit an amount, withdraw an amount, and get the balance.

If you try to withdraw an amount greater than the amount in the balance, your code should raise a ValueError.

Your balance should return as a currency string and not an integer.

All of your functionality should be built in the object.
