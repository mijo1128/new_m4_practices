In this practice you need to accomplish the following:

1. Create a model called TaxiBusiness.
2. In TaxiBusiness it should have the following fields:

- [ ] 'Occupied' a boolean stating if it's occupied or not.
- [ ] 'Capacity' an integer stating how many passengers can sit in the taxi
- [ ] 'Number of Passengers' an integer stating the current number of passengers
- [ ] 'Fare' a float stating the cost per mile for travel for that taxi.
- [ ] 'Taxi-Type' a string detailing the type of taxi (Van, Car, Bus).
- [ ] 'Taxi-Number' an integer stating the taxi number. This should start at 111 and increase by 11 each other instance of the taxi.
- [ ] 'Notes' an optional string field for any extra notations.

3. You should have the following functions capable in your model:

- [ ] Create a Taxi.
- [ ] Send the Taxi Out on a Fare - should change the number of passengers (cannot be greater than capacity) and occupied boolean to True.
- [ ] Finish a fare (should return a cost and take in a distance) and convert the number of passengers to 0 and the occupied boolean to False.
- [ ] Remove a Taxi from the system (Delete a taxi model)
- [ ] Find a Taxi - Search by Taxi Number to get a specific taxi.
- [ ] Filter un-occupied taxis - Filter by occupied status
- [ ] Filter by un-occupied and by capacity (over given number and is unoccupied)

4. You should write your own tests for each of these functionalities.
